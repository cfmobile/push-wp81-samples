Sample applications for the Push client library for Windows Universal (i.e.: 8.1+)


Pivotal Mobile Services Suite Push SDK Sample for WP8.1 and W8
==============================================================

Push SDK Usage
--------------

For more information please visit the [docs site](https://github.com/cfmobile/docs-pushnotifications-wp8)

Device Requirements
-------------------

The Push SDK requires Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 8.

Sample Application
------------------

The Push Sample Application is an example of the simplest application possible that uses the Pivotal Mobile Services Suite Push Client SDK. At this time, it only demonstrates how to register and unregister for push notifications.

This sample application registers for push notifications in the 'MainPage' class in order to make it easier to display the output on the screen. It is probably more appropriate for you to create a Service to handle Push actions and invoke it from your 'App' object.
